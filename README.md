# Web Design Assignment

Welcome to the Web Design Assignment! In this project, you will create a web page based on design images provided. The assignment involves HTML and CSS to replicate the design. You can find the design images here: [Image One (Full Design)](img/01.png) and [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](img/02.png).

## Assignment Details

### Design Resources
- Font: Roboto

### Project Structure
The website you are creating has four main sections and a footer. When tackling this project, it's a good idea to break it down into manageable steps. Here's our suggested approach:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin by taking one section at a time.
2. **Content First**: First, focus on getting all the content for the section onto the page. This involves creating the HTML structure for the section.
3. **Styling**: Once the content is in place, move on to styling the section using CSS. Remember to use the Roboto font as specified.
4. **Proceed Gradually**: It's a good practice to work on one section at a time, getting it into good shape before moving on to the next. Starting from the top and working your way down is often a solid plan.

### CSS Stylesheets
You do not need to use multiple stylesheets. One CSS file is sufficient for this project. Organize your styles within this single stylesheet.

### Flexbox Reference
If you encounter elements that require a refresher on using Flexbox, feel free to revisit the Flexbox exercises from your course material. Many elements on this page are similar to concepts covered in those exercises.

## Getting Started

1. Download the provided design images.
2. Create an HTML document.
3. Begin with one section at a time.
4. Build the HTML structure for that section.
5. Add the content to the HTML.
6. Apply CSS styling to make the section visually match the design.

## Example

To illustrate the approach, here's a simplified example of creating an HTML section and applying CSS styles:

```html
<!-- HTML for a Section -->
<section>
    <h1>Section Title</h1>
    <p>This is some content for the section.</p>
</section>
